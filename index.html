    <p>I am an analytical and creatively mindeded SaaS sales representative, working towards shifting my career into full stack web development.  Inspired to create things for the betterment of peoples daily lives, I have recently begun my journey to become a web developer at UC San Diego.  I am currently working to complete a full stack web development boot camp (expected finish date: August 8th).  I look forward to growing my existing knowledge of technology, as I take on many projects and continue networking with other professionals in the community.</p>

    <p>I enjoy traveling as it widens my cultural lens and I value gaining new perspectives of life.  I spend most of my free time outdoors and one of my proudest achievements was completion of the John Muir Trail; a 210 mile hike, across some of the most beautiful stretch of landscapes in California.  My other interests include reading, music, cooking, and surfing (in no particular order).  Suggestions in any of these categories are welcomed and encouraged!</p>
